# Overview

The Graphcool command line interface (CLI) is the primary tool to manage your Graphcool database services. Generally, the structure and behaviour of a Graphcool service are determined by the service definition file [`graphcool.yml`](!alias-foatho8aip).

The CLI offers tools to modify the local version of your service definition and file structure as well as syncing these changes with already deployed services.
